# MindAssist

Mind-controlled assistive robotic arm that pairs the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile EEG headset with the Hiwonder miniArm kit to let users trigger feeding and grasping routines through simple focus/relax/blink cues.


Problem statement:
MindAssist - “One in three U.S. stroke survivors faces food insecurity—nearly twice the rate of people without stroke—because they often can’t reliably feed themselves without assistance (American Heart Association, 2022). We’re building a mind-controlled assistive arm so survivors can trigger an entire feeding routine with simple mental states, restoring autonomy even when fine motor control is gone.”


## Hardware
- NeuroSky MindWave Mobile EEG headset
- Hiwonder / LewanSoul miniArm Standard Kit (5-DOF robotic arm with digital servos + Bluetooth)
- miniArm Atmega328 controller board (kit default)
